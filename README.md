# Welcome Message
Create a new project (Console Application) in Visual Studio called HelloWorld. 

Have it spit out a welcome message to the screen that varies depending on time of day. In other words, in the morning, say “Good Morning,” and so on for afternoon, and evening.

Hints:
-	If you run a console app from within Visual Studio, it will open, run, and then immediately shut. Since you’ll want to screenshot the output, make the app “wait” until the user presses the enter key. Check out the Console.ReadLine() method.
-	Remember the Console.WriteLine() method from last week.
